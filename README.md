 ## Lessons Learned

## 1. Requirements & Planning
- [ ] Define project objectives and features
- [ ] Sketch user flows and main functionalities
- [ ] Identify core features and external integrations

## 2. Design & Architecture
- [ ] Create UML diagrams or flowcharts
- [ ] Define interfaces (set contracts for modules)
- [ ] Plan your class hierarchy and component interactions

## 3. Set Up the Project Structure
- [ ] Create package structure (e.g., `com.msfg.projectname`)
- [ ] Set up build system (Maven/Gradle) and version control

## 4. Develop Core Interfaces & Domain Models
- [ ] Code your interfaces (service contracts, data repositories)
- [ ] Implement domain models (POJOs representing business entities)

## 5. Implement the Backbone
- [ ] Write core classes that implement the interfaces
- [ ] Build primary logic and workflows for a minimal viable version

## 6. Iterative Feature Development
- [ ] Add features incrementally
- [ ] Write unit tests for each module (TDD approach)

## 7. Integration & UI
- [ ] Integrate modules and connect the UI or API layer
- [ ] Build and refine front-end or REST endpoints

## 8. Testing & Debugging
- [ ] Run integration, system, and user acceptance tests
- [ ] Use your debugger (Eclipse/IntelliJ) to resolve issues

## 9. Optimization & Refactoring
- [ ] Clean up code and improve performance
- [ ] Add documentation and apply design patterns where needed

## 10. Deployment & Maintenance
- [ ] Package your application (JAR/WAR) and deploy it
- [ ] Set up monitoring and plan for future updates
